Scaling laws for reward model overoptimization
Oct 19, 2022October 19, 2022
 In reinforcement learning from human feedback, it is common to optimize
against a reward model trained to predict human preferences. Because the reward
model is an imperfect proxy, optimizing its value too much can hinder ground
truth performance, in accordance with Goodhart's law. This effect has been
frequently observed, but not carefully measured due to the expense of
collecting human preference data. In this work, we use a synthetic setup in
which a fixed "gold-standard" reward model plays the role of humans, providing
labels used to train a proxy reward model. We study how the gold reward model
score changes as we optimize against the proxy reward model using either
reinforcement learning or best-of-$n$ sampling. We find that this relationship
follows a different functional form depending on the method of optimization,
and that in both cases its coefficients scale smoothly with the number of
reward model parameters. We also study the effect on this relationship of the
size of the reward model dataset, the number of reward model and policy
parameters, and the coefficient of the KL penalty added to the reward in the
reinforcement learning setup. We explore the implications of these empirical
results for theoretical considerations in AI alignment.
