Forecasting potential misuses of language models for disinformation campaigns and how to reduce risk
Jan 11, 2023January 11, 2023
 Generative language models have improved drastically, and can now produce
realistic text outputs that are difficult to distinguish from human-written
content. For malicious actors, these language models bring the promise of
automating the creation of convincing and misleading text for use in influence
operations. This report assesses how language models might change influence
operations in the future, and what steps can be taken to mitigate this threat.
We lay out possible changes to the actors, behaviors, and content of online
influence operations, and provide a framework for stages of the language
model-to-influence operations pipeline that mitigations could target (model
construction, model access, content dissemination, and belief formation). While
no reasonable mitigation can be expected to fully prevent the threat of
AI-enabled influence operations, a combination of multiple mitigations may make
an important difference.
