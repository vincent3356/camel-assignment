Point-E: A system for generating 3D point clouds from complex prompts
Dec 16, 2022December 16, 2022
 While recent work on text-conditional 3D object generation has shown
promising results, the state-of-the-art methods typically require multiple
GPU-hours to produce a single sample. This is in stark contrast to
state-of-the-art generative image models, which produce samples in a number of
seconds or minutes. In this paper, we explore an alternative method for 3D
object generation which produces 3D models in only 1-2 minutes on a single GPU.
Our method first generates a single synthetic view using a text-to-image
diffusion model, and then produces a 3D point cloud using a second diffusion
model which conditions on the generated image. While our method still falls
short of the state-of-the-art in terms of sample quality, it is one to two
orders of magnitude faster to sample from, offering a practical trade-off for
some use cases. We release our pre-trained point cloud diffusion models, as
well as evaluation code and models, at https://github.com/openai/point-e.
